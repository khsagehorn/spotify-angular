# Spotifynd
A web application built with AngularJS and utilizing the Spotify API.

*The Spotify API endpoints used in this project are no longer publicly available.*

## What It Is:
The idea of this page is to allow a user to interact with data consumed from various Spotify API endpoints. The user searches for an artist, and the page displays related artists and a link to their spotify page. On desktop, the user has the option to listen to a 30 second preview right from the page. On mobile, the "preview" button becomes a link to the artists top track, with the option to open it in the Spotify App, if the user has it installed.

IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING MOBILE EMULATION:
If emulating mobile devices, such as with the developer tools in Chrome, the mobile links will be blocked as a popup. These links work on an actual mobile browser. 

## Tools Used
The data is displayed with the help of Angular, with Bootstrap used for styling and responsive design elements. CSS media queries are used to instruct both design and features on a variety of devices. Gulp is implemented as a task manager.
